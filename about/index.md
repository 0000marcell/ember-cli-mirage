## Why Mirage?

Nearly all Ember apps interact with a JSON API. When you hit the point during development when you need to interact with data from your backend, you have a few choices:

  1. Proxy your app's HTTP requests to a local or hosted version of the actual backend (if it exists)
  2. Use a library like [Pretender]() or [jQuery mockjax]() and write to intercept
